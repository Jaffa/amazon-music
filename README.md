AmazonMusic
===========

_AmazonMusic_ is an open source Python 2/3 library, providing access to Amazon Music/Prime Music's streaming service. It enables new applications to be written that use Amazon's service.

This is similar to other projects for other streaming services. For example, for Spotify use [`librespot`](https://github.com/plietar/librespot) and [`python-librespot`](https://github.com/plietar/python-librespot/) - based on Spotify's [`libspotify`](https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/libspotify/). Unfortunately, Amazon [don't offer an Amazon Music SDK](https://forums.developer.amazon.com/questions/58421/amazon-music-api.html), and this seems to be the first attempt to reverse engineer one.

Example usage
-------------

```python
from amazonmusic.amazonmusic import AmazonMusic
import os

am = AmazonMusic(credentials=['foo@example.com', 'xyzzy'])

station = am.create_station('A2UW0MECRAWILL')
print('Playing station {0}...'.format(station.name))

for t in station.tracks:
  print('Playing {0} by {1} from {2} [{3}]...'.format(t.name, t.artist, t.album, t.albumArtist))
  os.system('cvlc --play-and-exit "{0}"'.format(t.getUrl()))
```

_Note:_ hardcoding your Amazon credentials is a bad idea! `AmazonMusic` can be passed a lambda function that returns a two-element list. This will be called if a sign-in is necessary and can be used to prompt the user for their credentials. For example:

```python
from getpass import getpass

# Make Python 2 work like Python 3
try: input = raw_input
except NameError: pass

# Prompt the user for the credentials, when needed
am = AmazonMusic(credentials = lambda: [input('Email: '), getpass('Amazon password: ')])
```

### Dependencies

The [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) libraries are required beyond the standard Python libraries. These can be usually be installed using your standard package manager or `pip`:

Operating environment    | Python version | Packages
-------------------------|----------------|----------------
Debian, Ubuntu           | 2              | `python-requests`, `python-bs4`
Debian, Ubuntu           | 3              | `python3-requests`, `python3-bs4`
cygwin                   | 2              | `python2-requests`, `python2-bs4`
cygwin                   | 3              | `python3-requests`, `python3-bs4`
pip (e.g. OS X Homebrew) | 2 & 3          | `requests`, `beautifulsoup4`

Features
--------

* Play album by ASIN
* Play station by ASIN
* Play playlist by ASIN
* Library access - saved albums
* Supports Amazon Music with Prime subscriptions, with multiple regions [needs testing]
* Supports Python 2 & Python 3

### Roadmap
Short term:

* Searching [in progress]
* Library access - saved playlists
* Browse recommendations
* Browse stations

Medium term:

* Ensure full Amazon Music Unlimited subscriptions are supported
* Better handling of a captcha during authentication

Possible long term:

* Better examples (full Amazon Music client?)
* Manage library (e.g. create playlists)
* Play tracks without an external player (such as `cvlc`)

Never:

* Features that facilitate piracy (such as track downloading): the library is to allow streaming only

If you would like to contribute to development, or understand how the library - or Amazon Music - works, see [DEVELOPMENT](DEVELOPMENT.md) for more information.

Examples
--------

Several examples are included. To run them:

1. Enure your working directory contains the `amazonmusic.py` library
2. Set `PYTHONPATH` and run them in Python:

```sh
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/play-album.py
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/play-station.py
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/play-playlist.py
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/my-library.py
```

Default ASINs for albums, stations and playlists are defaulted within the examples, but alternatives can be provided as a command line argument. The `search.py` example can be used to find alternatives (although the raw JSON needs to be manually parsed at the moment):

```
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/search.py Adele 25
```

```JSON
[...]
      {
        "document": {
          "__type": "com.amazon.music.platform.model#CatalogAlbum",
          "artFull": {
            "URL": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A170tH1apiL._AA500.jpg",
            "__type": "com.amazon.music.platform.model#ArtURL",
            "artUrl": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/A170tH1apiL._AA500.jpg"
          },
          "artistAsin": "B001EEJMYG",
          "artistName": "Adele",
          "asin": "B0170UQ0OC",
          "isMusicSubscription": "true",
          "originalReleaseDate": 1447977600.0,
          "primaryGenre": "Pop",
          "primeStatus": "PRIME",
          "title": "25",
          "trackCount": 11
        }
      },
```

```sh
PYTHONPATH=. python examples/play-album.py B0170UQ0OC
```

Background
----------
I have a long term plan to build an integrated smart home with voice assistant (possibly using the likes of [spaCy](https://spacy.io/), [Snowboy](https://snowboy.kitt.ai/), [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/), [Mopidy](https://www.mopidy.com/) and [respeaker-avs](https://github.com/respeaker/avs)). As an Amazon Prime subscriber, I get access to Prime Music - which just about covers my streaming audio needs. Unfortunately, Alexa Voice Service [only allows people actively working with Amazon on commercial products](https://github.com/alexa-pi/AlexaPi/wiki/Q&A-(FAQ)#does-alexapi-support-amazon-music) under NDA to access Amazon Music.

Switching to Spotify will cost money. Commercialising the integrating smart home solution might be an even longer term plan, but I don't want to predicate access on that. Reverse engineering Amazon Music - or getting Amazon to provide an API - so that it can be added to projects like Mopidy seems like the best way forward.
